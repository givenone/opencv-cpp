    "## <font style = \"color:rgb(50,120,229)\">Introduction</font>\n",
    "In many applications, we need to know how the head is tilted with respect to a camera. In a virtual reality application, for example, one can use the pose of the head to render the right view of the scene. In a driver assistance system, a camera looking at a driver’s face in a vehicle can use head pose estimation to see if the driver is paying attention to the road. And of course one can use head pose based gestures to control a hands-free application / game. For example, yawing your head left to right can signify a NO. \n",
    "## <font style = \"color:rgb(50,120,229)\">What is pose estimation?</font>\n",
    "In computer vision, the pose of an object refers to its relative orientation and position with respect to a camera. You can change the pose by either moving the object with respect to the camera, or the camera with respect to the object.\n",
    "The pose estimation problem described in this tutorial is often referred to as Perspective-n-Point problem or PNP in computer vision jargon. As we shall see in the following sections in more detail, in this problem the goal is to find the pose of an object when we have a calibrated camera, and we know the locations of n 3D points on the object and the corresponding 2D projections in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <font style = \"color:rgb(50,120,229)\">How to mathematically represent camera motion ?</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "A 3D rigid object has only two kinds of motions with respect to a camera:\n",
    "1. **Translation:** Moving the camera from its current 3D location *(X, Y, Z)* to a new 3D location *(X', Y', Z')* is called translation. As you can see translation has 3 degrees of freedom — you can move in the X, Y or Z direction. Translation is represented by a vector *t* which is equal to *(X'-X, Y'-Y, Z'-Z)*.\n",
    "2. **Rotation:** You can also rotate the camera about the X, Y and Z axes. A rotation, therefore, also has three degrees of freedom. There are many ways of representing rotation. You can represent it using **Euler angles**( roll, pitch and yaw ), a 3X3 **rotation matrix**, or a **direction of rotation (i.e. axis ) and angle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, estimating the pose of a 3D object means finding 6 numbers — three for translation and three for rotation.\n",

    "To calculate the 3D pose of an object in an image you need the following information:\n",
    "+ **2D coordinates of a few points :** You need the 2D (x, y) locations of a few points in the image. In the case of a face, you could choose the corners of the eyes, the tip of the nose, corners of the mouth etc. Dlib’s facial landmark detector provides us with many points to choose from. In this tutorial, we will use the tip of the nose, the chin, the left corner of the left eye, the right corner of the right eye, the left corner of the mouth, and the right corner of the mouth.\n",
    "+ **3D locations of the same points :** You also need the 3D location of the 2D feature points. You might be thinking that you need a 3D model of the person in the photo to get the 3D locations. Ideally yes, but in practice, you don’t. A generic 3D model will suffice. Where do you get a 3D model of a head from ? Well, you really don’t need a full 3D model. You just need the 3D locations of a few points in some arbitrary reference frame. In this tutorial, we are going to use the following 3D points.\n",

    "+    **Intrinsic parameters of the camera**. As mentioned before, in this problem the camera is assumed to be calibrated. In other words, you need to know the focal length of the camera, the optical center in the image and the radial distortion parameters. So you need to calibrate your camera. There is a trick to solve this problem too. We can approximate the optical center by the center of the image, approximate the focal length by the width of the image in pixels and assume that radial distortion does not exist.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are three coordinate systems in play here. The 3D coordinates of the various facial features shown above are in world coordinates. If we knew the rotation and translation (i.e. pose), we could transform the 3D points in **world coordinates** to 3D points in **camera coordinates**. The 3D points in camera coordinates can be projected onto the image plane (i.e. **image coordinate system**) using the intrinsic parameters of the camera (focal length, optical center etc.).\n",

In the figure above, *o* is the center of the camera and plane shown in the figure is the image plane. We are interested in finding out what equations govern the projection p of the 3D point P onto the image plane.\n",

    "Let’s assume we know the location(U, V, W)of a 3D point Pin World Coordinates. If we know the rotation R(3×3 matrix) and translation t (3×1 vector), of the world coordinates with respect to the camera coordinates, we can calculate the location (X, Y, Z) of the point Pin the camera coordinate system using the following equation.\n",

Note that all the points along the ray joining the center of the camera and point $P$ produce the same image.

    "## <font style = \"color:rgb(50,120,229)\">Levenberg-Marquardt Optimization</font>\n",
    "The DLT solution mentioned above is not very accurate because of the following reasons . First, rotation has three degrees of freedom but the matrix representation used in the DLT solution has 9 numbers. There is nothing in the DLT solution that forces the estimated $3x3$ matrix to be a rotation matrix. More importantly, the DLT solution does not minimize the correct objective function. Ideally, we want to minimize the reprojection error that is described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the equations 2 and 3, if we knew the right pose ( $R$ and $t$ ), we could predict the 2D locations of the 3D facial points on the image by projecting the 3D points onto the 2D image. In other words, if we knew $R$ and $t$ we could find the point $p$ in the image for every 3D point $P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also know the 2D facial feature points ( using Dlib or manual clicks ). We can look at the distance between projected 3D points and 2D facial features. When the estimated pose is perfect, the 3D points projected onto the image plane will line up almost perfectly with the 2D facial features. When the pose estimate is incorrect, we can calculate a re-projection error measure — the sum of squared distances between the projected 3D points and 2D facial feature points.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, an approximate estimate of the pose ($R$ and $t$) can be found using the DLT solution. A naive way to improve the DLT solution would be to randomly change the pose ( $R$ and $t$) slightly and check if the reprojection error decreases. If it does, we can accept the new estimate of the pose. We can keep perturbing $R$ and $t$ again and again to find better estimates. While this procedure will work, it will be very slow. Turns out there are principled ways to iteratively change the values of $R$ and $t$ so that the reprojection error decreases. One such method is called Levenberg-Marquardt optimization. Check out more details on Wikipedia article on [Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenberg%E2%80%93Marquardt_algorithm)."

This one data point can dominate the least squares solution and our estimate of the line would be very wrong. In RANSAC, the parameters are estimated by randomly selecting the minimum number of points required. In a line fitting problem, we randomly select two points from all data and find the line passing through them. Other data points that are close enough to the line are called inliers.

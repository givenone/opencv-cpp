    "In a previous lecture we learned how approximating a nonlinear warp with piecewise linear map can lead to huge gains in efficiency. The next obvious question is how to generate these non-overlapping triangles that cover the entire image. \n",

    "Given a set of points in a plane, a triangulation refers to the subdivision of the plane into triangles, with the points as vertices. In Figure 1, we see a set of points on the left image shown using red dots and the triangulation shown using white lines. \n",
    "\n",
    "A set of points can have many possible triangulations, but Delaunay triangulation stands out because it has some nice properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a Delaunay triangulation, triangles are chosen such that **no point is inside the circumcircle of any triangle**. Figure 2. shows Delaunay triangulation of 4 points A, B, C and D.  The difference between the top and the bottom images is that in the top image, point C is further away from line BD as compared to the bottom image. This movement of point C changes the Delaunay triangulation. \n",

    "An interesting property of Delaunay triangulation is that it does not favor **\"skinny\"** triangles ( i.e. triangles with one large angle ).\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2 shows how the triangulation changes to pick \"fat\" triangles when the points are moved. In the top image, the points B and D have their x-coordinates at x = 1.5, and in the bottom image they are moved to the right to x = 1.75. In the top image angles ABC and ABD are large, and Delaunay triangulation creates an edge between B and D splitting the two large angles into smaller angles ABD, ADB, CDB, and CBD. On the other hand in the bottom image, the angle BCD is too large, and Delaunay triangulation creates an edge AC to divide the large angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many algorithms to find the Delaunay triangulation of a set of points. The most obvious ( but not the most efficient ) one is to start with any triangulation, and check if the circumcircle of any triangle contains another point. If it does, flip the edges ( as shown in Figure 2. ) and continue until there are no triangles whose circumcircle contains a point.\n",
